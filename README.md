# My first JavaScript projects

This project contains a set of challenges I executed while learning Typescript.

The first challenge is 1) The Secret Santa Coding Challenge (secret-santa-draw) which is a program that randomly assigns each participant in a list to another participant as their Secret Santa. Each participant should give a gift to exactly one other participant and receive a gift from exactly one other participant.

The second challenge is 2) The MARS Rover Coding Challenge (mars-rovers) which is a program that receives a set of coordinates for the size of a plateau and coordinates and list of movements for 1 or more rovers. The program then uses these coordinates and plateau size to calculate the final position of the rovers after executing the movements specified in the input. In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot.
'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.
Input should be added to variable input1 in the end of file index.ts.
