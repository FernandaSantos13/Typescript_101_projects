# My first JavaScript projects

This project contains a set of challenges I executed while learning Typescript.

The first challenge is 1) The Secret Santa Coding Challenge (secret-santa-draw) which is a program that randomly assigns each participant in a list to another participant as their Secret Santa. Each participant should give a gift to exactly one other participant and receive a gift from exactly one other participant.
